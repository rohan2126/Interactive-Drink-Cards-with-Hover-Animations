🍹 Drink Cards with Hover Animations

This project is a collection of visually appealing drink brand cards, each featuring unique hover animations, product images, and interactive elements. Built entirely with HTML & CSS, it highlights creative use of transitions and modern web design techniques to make each card feel alive as the user interacts with it.
🔥 Features:

    Hover Animations: Smooth CSS transitions that expand the card and reveal detailed content upon hovering, offering a rich user experience.
    Product Showcase: Eye-catching beverage product images (Coca-Cola, Sprite, Red Bull, and Frooti) that dynamically scale and rotate, providing a visually immersive display.
    Responsive Design: Each card's design adapts gracefully when hovered over, thanks to flexbox layouts and CSS transforms.
    Vibrant Colors: Custom color schemes for each drink card to match the branding, making them easily distinguishable.
    Interactive Content: Product descriptions and a clickable "Explore More" button appear with smooth transitions for added interactivity.

🎯 How It Works:

    When you hover over a card, the card smoothly expands while the product image animates into a larger size.
    The logo fades out and is replaced by a product image and description, creating an intuitive, engaging interaction.

📂 Project Structure:

    HTML: The cards are structured in simple and clean HTML with semantic tags for accessibility.
    CSS: All styling, animations, and hover effects are managed with CSS, using properties like transform, transition, and custom CSS variables for color management.
